// dynamically allocated inside the function, and a pointer is passed to the user.
// It is the user's responsibility to free the memory afterwards.  
// IMPORTANT:  Since the objects are allocated within SISL (which is written in 
// pure C), the C memory allocation functions are used.  To 'free' a SISLCurve 
// pointed to by 'c', you should call 'freeCurve(c)'.  The command to free
// SISLSurf objects is 'freeSurf()'.

// on the Go format.  It is unrelated to SISL, but useful when you want to
// visualise 3D-points with the Go-compatible viewer.

// Go-format to the stream.  The number of points is indicated by 'num_points'.
